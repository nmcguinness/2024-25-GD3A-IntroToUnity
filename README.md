| Topic | Description | Additional Reading |
| :---------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | 
| Example 2 - Scriptable Objects | Sharing variables across multiple game objects using ScriptableObjects (SOs) | See RotationBehaviour and Variables in Common/Scripts/ScriptableObjects |
| Example 3 - Selection Manager - Simple | Writing a better SelectionManager using Design Patterns (Abstract Factory, Strategy) | See SelectionManager and SimpleSelectionManager |

### To Do - Week 3 - 4
- [x] Add Editor tools (inspector lock, folder generation)
- [ ] Scriptable Objects - Add a demo to demonstrate a centrally modified game variable
- [ ] Discuss generic classes - see [Intro to C#](https://github.com/nmcguinness/2024_25---GD---CSharp---Intro.git)
- [ ] Scriptable Objects - Add a local/remote reference variable demo
- [ ] Scriptable Objects - Add a framework for interactable, consumable, game, and level data
- [ ] Add a SimpleSelectionManager as a starting point to discuss Abstract Factory and Strategy patterns
- [ ] Apply Abstract Factory and Strategy patterns to make an improved SelectionManager
